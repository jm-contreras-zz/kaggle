**Repository of R scripts that I wrote to take part in three predictive modeling competitions hosted by [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/).** Each script assumes that the training and testing data from its respective competition are located in the same directory in the form of CSV files. Two of the scripts make reference to a feature selection wrapper.

- ***titanic.R*** performs a one- or two-way [analysis of variance (ANOVA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance) as a wrapper to two scripts that are not mine, *anova_rm.m* and *rm_anova2.m*.
